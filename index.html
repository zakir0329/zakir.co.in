           Article 370 of the Indian constitution is a special provision in the Indian constitution which allows the state of Jammu and Kashmir to draft its own constitution and put curbs on the power of the Indian Union over the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Basically, it granted a high amount of autonomous powers to the Jammu and Kashmir legislature.
           
           Except for defence, communication, foreign affairs and financier, the Jammu and Kashmir leaders had enormous power over the states without the impending influence of the Indian central government. Leaders have used the powers of article 370 to form their own laws and put in place restrictions for the people of Jammu and Kashmir. This special status will empower the state with a separate constitution, flag and national anthem. Also, the people of Jammu and Kashmir will be eligible for dual citizenship. The assembly of the state can make its laws for land and properties, and they have banned people outside Jammu and Kashmir to buy land in the state.
           
           All this came to a sudden halt when article 370 was abrogated in 2019. As this article 370 of the Indian constitution essay in being written, a curfew is imposed all over the state of Jammu and Kashmir, for over a year now, to prevent unrest and violence in the state as a result of the abrogation of article 370.
           
           Now that the special powers are taken away from the government of Jammu and Kashmir, two new union territories in India is formed, which are a union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and Union territory of Ladakh, Leh and Kargil. The whole region is under the control of the Indian central government and AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act), which gives powers to the Indian army to detain anyone suspicious without any kind of accountability and trial, is put in place in certain sensitive regions of the state.
           
           Some say the abrogation was unconstitutional and authoritarian in nature. But the fact of the matter is that abrogation has caused enormous amounts of unrest in the state with curfews being imposed for over a year now and an unspeakable amount of humanitarian crisis looming over the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
